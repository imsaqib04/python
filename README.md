## üìú Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+** installed on your system  
- Basic knowledge of programming concepts
- Recommended: Install **pip** for Python package management

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd python-udemy-KrishNiak
````

2. **Create and activate virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   # Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   # macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies** (if required for specific folders)

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run a Python file**

   ```bash
   python path/to/script.py
   ```

## üìå Notes

* Each folder is **self-contained** ‚Äî you can open it and run examples independently.
* For web apps (Flask/Streamlit), navigate to the respective folder and run:

  ```bash
  flask run
  ```

  or

  ```bash
  streamlit run app.py
  ```
